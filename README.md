- HTML : is the building block of websites. It is the programming language used to describe and mark content, so a browser displays it correctly. We can define it as a set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet.

- CSS : looks more like a set of instructions that control a webpage’s style and structure than a programming language. It helps developers manage a website or web application’s formatting, presentation, and layout. While HTML defines elements on a page, CSS dictates how users see the content. For instance, it controls the size, border, and alignment of an image in a blog post.

- JavaScript : Frontend developers can already create websites using HTML and CSS. In fact, it wasn’t until 1995 that JavaScript emerged. However, it is now difficult to imagine websites without JavaScript as it enables developers to make sites interactive. The programming language can change website content based on a user’s action.
